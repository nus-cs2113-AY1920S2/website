#### {{ thumb(1) }} Demo iP using the jar file

* Copy your iP jar file to an empty folder.
* Do a quick demo of it to the tutor.

#### {{ thumb(2) }} Demo debugging in an IDE

<box light type="success" add-class="ml-4" icon=":fas-lightbulb:">

**Suggested pre-tutorial preparations**:
* Clone the [{{ module_org }}/personbook]({{ module_org }}/personbook) repo to your Computer (no need to fork first).
* Set it up in your IDE.
* Use the IDE debugging to step through the code to understand how the code works.

<div class="indented">

During the tutorial, **demo your ability to do debugging using an IDE** by performing the following tasks:

1. Set a breakpoint in the following method of the `Main` class.
   ```java
   /** Reads the user command and executes it, until the user issues the exit command.  */
   private void runCommandLoopUntilExitCommand() {
       Command command;
       do {
           String userCommandText = ui.getUserCommand();
           command = new Parser().parseCommand(userCommandText);
           CommandResult result = executeCommand(command);
           personBook.setLastShownList(result.getRelevantPersons());
           ui.showResultToUser(result);
   
       } while (!ExitCommand.isExit(command));
   }
   ```
1. Use the debugger to step through the code while explaining how the code works.
1. Show how to set a conditional breakpoint so that execution pauses when the user types in the command `list`.

#### {{ thumb(3) }} Show your tP UG draft

* Show to the tutor your UG draft that you uploaded to LumiNUS.
