**JavaFX is not required for this module** as we strongly discourage you from creating a GUI app. If you are still interest to learn JavaFX, you can refer to the JavaFX tutorial in the [Duke repo you used for the iP]({{ module_org }}/duke#tutorials) (reason: the tutorials in the section below are outdated).

**You'll need to add JavaDoc comments to the iP code this week. When adding a user guide to the iP, you'll need to use Markdown.** Both those topics are covered below, briefly.

%%FYI, AsciiDoc is a more powerful (but also more complicated) replacement for Markdown. You don't need it for this module.%%
