#### {{ thumb(1) }} **Discuss tP progress**

* Show your collaborative project doc(s) to the tutor.
* Share the project direction (i.e., user profile, value proposition) you have decided upon.
* Give feedback to the other team. Some examples:
  * Suppose you belong to the proposed target user group; do you find the value proposition attractive?
  * Do you foresee any potential violation of the project constraints?

#### {{ thumb(2) }} **Review Peer iP PRs**

<div class="indented-level2">
<box type="important">

The quality of the work you will do in this tutorial task will be considered for your iP grade.
</box>

**Review a PR** created by your classmates by following the steps given below. Note that you are expected to have read the following guidelines as given in this week's iP tasks:

{{ embed_topic("../../admin/appendixE-gitHub.md#pr-review-guidelines", "Admin " + icon_embedding + " **Using GitHub â†’ Guidelines for Reviewing PRs**", "3", indent="1") }}
</div>

* {{ step(1) }} **Form sub-groups** of 2 (preferred) or 3 (if unavoidable) members. %%You can form sub-groups between tP teams that are under the same tutor.%%
* {{ step(2) }} **Open the PR allocated to you**, as given in the panel below.
<div class="indented-level2">

<panel header="iP PR review allocation" minimized >
(The allocation of which PRs to review will be specified nearer to the date)
</panel>
<p/>

{{ icon_info }} If the student you have been allocated to review has not created a PR (or the PR has a trivial amount of code), you can review the same PR as your sub-team member(s) instead. Failing that too, you can choose another PR that is allocated to another student in your own team, or your own tutorial.

<box type="tip" light>

Tip for future reference: GitHub allows you to filter PRs/Issues using various criteria such as `author:AuthorUsername` ([example](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Afzdy1914+) -- see the `filters` text box in the target page).

Alternatively, you can use PR labels (if any) to filter PRs/Issues.<br>

* {{ step(3) }} **Review the code for [coding standard]({{ java_coding_standard }}) compliance**. You can view the code in the PR by clicking on the {{ show_as_rounded_tab('Files changed') }} tab. When you find a possible coding standard violation, do the following:
  1. **Show it to your review partner(s) to confirm** it is indeed a violation. You can seek tutor's opinion if you are not sure.
  1. **Add a comment** to communicate your finding with the author.<br>
     * Hover over the offending line of code and click on the {{ button('**+**', 'primary') }} that appears to start the comment.
     * Write your comment ({{ icon_tip }} You can use [GFMD](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax in your comment)<br>
       e.g., `Shouldn't this be **in a new line**, as per our _coding standard_? :thinking:`<br>
       > Shouldn't this be **in a new line**, as per our _coding standard_? :thinking:
     * When you are done writing the comment, click on the {{ button('**Start a review**', 'success') }} (not the {{ button('**Add single comment**') }} button)

* {{ step(4) }} **Review the code for code quality** best practices you have learned so far. When you find a potential opportunity to improve the code quality, confirm with your review partners (and the tutor, if needed) and add a comment as before. Some code quality issues you can check for (not an exhaustive list):
  * Methods that are too long
  * Code nested too deeply
  * Not enough SLAP
  * Names that can be improved
  * Logic hard to understand

* {{ step(5) }} **Finish the review**. When it is time to end the tutorial, finish the review as follows:
  1. Click on the {{ button('**Finish your review**', 'success') }} at the top of the page.
  1. Choose the `Comment` option (not `Approve` or `Request changes`).
  1. In the comment box, mention your review partners e.g., `Also took part in this review @JonhDoe`. You can also give an overall comment about the code e.g.,
     ```
     Overall, we found your code easy to read for the most part except a few places
     where the nesting was too deep. Hope our comments help you improve the code further.
     All the best for your iP :-)
     ```
  1. Click on the {{ button('**Submit review**', 'success') }} button to finish the review.
