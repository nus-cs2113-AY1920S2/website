#### {{ thumb(1) }} Demo {{ penultimate_version }}

* One member is to do a quick demo of your `{{ penultimate_version }}` ==using the jar file==. Make sure the jar file is ==in an empty folder== before you start. Others can help to confirm the jar file works on other OS'es.

* **Go to the PR** of the allocated team.
* **Open the DG of that team in another Browser tab**.
* **Confirm that the DG has significant updates**, to the diagrams in particular. If it doesn't, you can review the _backup_ team (given within brackets). %%If even the backup team is not suitable, ask the tutor for a suggestion or choose any random teams having tutorials in the same day.%%
* **Evaluate the `Design` and the `Implementation` sections w.r.t possible DG bugs** (given further down); add your observations as comments.<br>

* To be done collectively with sub-team members.
* Add _review comments_ in the corresponding place of the code. But ==if the <tooltip content="i.e., the tab named `Files changed`">_diff view_</tooltip> is too laggy, you can use a normal comment==.
* Choose the `Start a review` option rather than `Add single comment`.
* Each person can do their own review, but coordinate with sub-team members to avoid duplicating the same point.
* Phrase your comments as question/doubts (e.g., `Is this format correct? Should it be ... instead?`) rather than directives (e.g., `Change this to ...`).
* Where possible, use screenshots from their DG in your comments, preferably with annotations. This is particularly useful when commenting on diagrams.
* Do not finalize the review at this stage. Just keep adding comments.
* <span class="text-success">**The understanding you gain from this exercise can indirectly determine how well you do in your own project.**</span> ==If you have even the slightest doubt about your observations in this exercise, please discuss it with the tutor== to ensure you have the right understanding of the criteria used.
