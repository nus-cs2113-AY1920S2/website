Good news: this will the the last installment of UML notations.<br>
Bad news: we are going to cover an entire new diagram type in one go (reason: to give you more time to use them in project documentation).

**Let us learn a UML diagram type that can be used to model a _behavioral_ aspect of software entities**; in contrast, CD/OD's that you learned in the past two weeks model _structural_ aspects.

Last week, we learned:
* Three basic design quality aspects: abstraction, coupling, cohesion
* Two design principles that aims to improve those aspects: SRP, SoC. There are many more principles but we covered only two (to reduce workload) just to give you a taste only.
**This week, we cover _design patterns_, which builds upon the above**. Again, we limit to only two of them, for similar reasons.

Previously, you learned how to write JUnit tests. **How do you know which parts of the code is being tested by your tests? That's where _test coverage_ comes in.**
