    <h4 id="when-to-form-teams">When to form teams</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>CS2113T: Your team will be formed by the CS2101 side.</li>
      <li>CS2113: Your team will be formed at the <em>start</em> of the week 3 tutorial. Please try to arrive on time for that tutorial; if you are not there at the team forming time and others in the class are unaware which team you wanted to be in, we'll
        have to put you into a team randomly.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="team-size">Team size</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The default <mark>team size is five</mark>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="team-composition">Team composition</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>We allow some freedom in choosing team members, subject to these constraints:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>All team members should be in the same tutorial.</strong> <mark>Delay forming teams until your place in a tutorial is confirmed.</mark> We do not allow changing tutorials to team up with your preferred team mates.</li>
          <li><strong>Teams of single nationality are not allowed</strong> unless the only language common among all team members is English. e.g. an all-Singaporean team that include both Chinese and Malay students. <span class="dimmed">Rationale: to train you to work in multicultural teams, to ensure that English is used for all project communication</span></li>
          <li><strong>No more than one exchange students per team</strong> <span class="dimmed">Rationale: to increase interaction between exchange students and NUS students.</span></li>
          <li><strong>Same gender teams are discouraged but allowed.</strong> <span class="dimmed">Rationale: to train you for mixed-gender work environments.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>We may modify teams</strong> when circumstances call for it. There is no avenue for you to object. Staying with your preferred team is not guaranteed.</li>
    </ul>

  <div id="teamIdFormat">
    <h4 id="team-id">Team ID</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To be given to you after forming teams.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Has the form <code>TUTORIAL_ID-TEAM_NUMBER</code></strong> e.g, <code>CS2113-W14-2</code> means you are in tutorial <code>CS2113-W14</code> (i.e., in module <code>CS2113</code>, on <code>Wednesday</code>, at <code>1400-1500</code>), team
        <code>2</code>.</li>

    <h4 id="team-communications">Team Communications</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use English</strong> for all team communications, both spoken and written.</li>
      <li><strong>We recommend at least one 1-2 hour <mark>face-to-face</mark> project meeting per week</strong>, in addition to any online meetings. <span class="dimmed">Reason: you need to know how to run both types of project meetings</span>. The project
        meeting time can be used to discuss project related things, but also, can be used as a time for team members to work on the project tasks individually (having all members in the same place will facilitate easier collaboration and more peer-learning).</li>
      <li><strong>Fix a weekly 1-2 hour time slot and a venue for project meetings</strong> after the team has been finalized (latest by week 3 tutorial). <mark>All members are expected to attend weekly project meetings</mark> (not doing so could lower the
        peer evaluation ratings you receive, which in turn will be factored into your grade).<br>
        <span class="badge badge-pill badge-warning"><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-lightbulb"></span></span> The best time to have the weekly project meeting is, after the previous week's lecture but before the deadline for weekly tasks.</li>
