My understanding for this problem is that: Previously, there is no data/duke.txt. When we first run duke, it will be created. Therefore, we may need to add code to create a data folder and a duke.txt. This may solve both jar problem and test-ui problem?

I think that is what you need. finalize() is called before the garbage collector tries to release the unreferenced object memory, and you can put the decrement of the static class variable in the finalize() method. But when the garbage collector works is totally up to jvm, even you reference an object to null, the JVM may start garbage collection only when it runs out of memory. so the finalize method may not be called throughout the entire programme running time.
Correct me if I am wrong.

GBK is the encoding for Chinese characters... and 0xBF is part of the BOM header.

Probably saving the objects(tasks) into file as json string, and loading json string from the file back to objects.
but acually ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream can do the work well already, just the output file is in binary, and cannot be edited by text editor.

-Dfile.encoding=UTF8, I am still having problems with the command prompt not displaying UTF-8 characters when I tried running the JAR file which I created.

createNewFile will try to create the file according to the path you have specified in the File object. If the directory your jar file is located in does not have a subfolder path "src/main/java/data", it will throw an error. So maybe you could try to see how you can rectify this error.

Relative path points to the path of the file relative to your current location/directory.  So say if I'm in "./src/main" and I want to access "./src/main/java/duke/duke.txt", the relative path would be "java/duke/duke.txt". 

For the jar case, you could run it in an empty directory eg "test". So for this example, the jar file will try to locate the saved tasklist file in whatever relative path you specified ie "test/\<relativepath\>"

This was what I used previously. I actually redid a lot of my code so it looks different now.
The brute force rewriting of the file was just a temporary measure as I was more focused on getting the reading and saving parts to work.

I understand that Java uses garbage collector and thus, there is no need for destructor methods. But without destructors, how can I know the total number of objects within a class during runtime?

class WordComparator {

I could not run my code on repl.it as it kept giving me this error.
"Error: Could not find or load main class Main
exit status 1"

I do not encounter this issue when I compile and run my code on cmd.exe.
Unable to resolve this issue. Should I just submit my code?

Thanks for your input. I manage to get past the problem. Now I'm having this error "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0
	at Main.main(Main.java:3)
exit status 1"
I googled that it means that there is no additional argument as I compile and run the code on repl.it, which causes my code to get that error

ACTUAL.TXT is generated by the script and contains the actual output from the program, so it doesn't need to be present before the script runs. If ACTUAL.TXT is present, the script deletes it before compiling and running the program again (e.g. in the .bat script on line 7):

`del ACTUAL.TXT`

Are you building the project before running it again? Normally if you made edits and then pressed run it should automatically build it before running, but maybe this feature could have been disabled in the settings. Have you tried going to Build -> Clean build?

Filename and class name should be the same. You can try doing a copy of it on your desktop and save the file as WordComparator.java and try running it. If it works, you can just paste the code and submit. Hope it helps!
