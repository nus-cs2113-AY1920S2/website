    </p>
    <p>Accordingly, the tP is structured to resemble an early stage of a small software project in which you will,</p>
    <ol>
      <li>conceptualize and implement a product, and,</li>
      <li>have it ready to be continued by future developers</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The focus of the tP is to learn the following aspects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><s>coding</s></li>
      <li>working in a team</li>
      <li>process/workflow</li>
      <li>documentation</li>
      <li>scheduling and tracking project progress, meeting delivery deadline</li>
      <li>quality assurance</li>
    </ul>

<h3 id="direction"><div class="text-white bg-dark p-1">Direction</div></h3>
<p>You may develop any product provide it is meant for users who can type fast, and prefer typing over mouse/voice commands. Therefore, <mark>Command Line Interface (CLI) is the primary mode of input.</mark></p>

        <ul>
          <li>It is an opportunity to exercise your product design skills because optimizing the product to a very specific target user requires good product design skills.</li>
          <li>It minimizes the overlap between features of different teams which can cause plagiarism issues. Furthermore, higher the number of other teams having the same features, less impressive your work becomes especially if others have done a better

      <li><strong>Define a clear <em>value proposition</em></strong> that matches the target user profile i.e., what problem does the product solve? how does it make the the user's life easier?</li>
      <li><strong>Optimize the product to the chosen target users</strong> i.e., add features that are especially/only applicable for target users (to make the app especially attractive to them).
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Example 1: If the product targets CS2113/T instructors, there can be features that are applicable to them only, <span class="dimmed">such as the ability to navigate to a student's project on GitHub</span></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Example 2: If your app manages contacts, you can optimize its features based on,</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the profession of the target user <span class="dimmed">e.g. doctors, salesmen, teachers, etc.</span></li>
              <li>the nature/scale of contacts <span class="dimmed">e.g. huge number of contacts (for HR admins, user group admins), mostly incomplete contacts, highly volatile contact details, contacts become inactive after a specific period (e.g. contract employees)</span></li>
              <li>what users do with the contacts <span class="dimmed">e.g. organize group events, share info, do business, do analytics</span></li>

            <p><span class="badge badge-pill badge-warning"><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-lightbulb"></span></span> Your project will be graded based on how well the features match the target user profile and how well the features fit-together.</p>
