            <p>Hi Prof,</p>
            <p>One of my teammates does not have her profile picture available on the Project List webpage, despite it being uploaded. My guess was that it was not uploaded to the repo in all-lower caps. We've since fixed it (renamed to all lower caps).</p>
            <p>Do we have to make sure that the photo shows up on the project list page before submission?</p>
            <p>My group is CS2103T-T13-3.</p>
            <p>Thank you in advance!

            <p>Hi Prof,</p>
            <p>Is it a requirement that Duke takes in commands within one line?</p>
            <p>Currently the command syntax goes roughly like this:</p>
            <p>/
              <command>
                <description>
                  <date></date>
                </description>
            </p>
            <p>I have been thinking of modifying Duke to interface with a user interactively, e.g.</p>
            <p>Duke: Hello, what can I do for you today?</p>
            <p>User: add deadline</p>
            <p>Duke: Sure, what will your deadline's description be?</p>
            <p>User: return book</p>
            <p>Duke: And when is it due?</p>
            <p>User: 10/09/2019 2100</p>
            <p>Duke: Okay, I've added a new task: [D][x] return book (by: 10/09/2019 2100)</p>
            <p>or would this be in violation of the fundamental purpose/target audience/intended use/learning point of Duke?</p>
            <p>Thanks in advance!

            <p>Hi,</p>
            <p>I'm trying to get IntelliJ to be compliant with the <a href="https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/website/coding-standards/java/intermediate.html">specified code style</a>.</p>
            <p>However, I seem to be having some difficulties with trying to get IntelliJ to save the settings:</p>
            <p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4518827/63735579-ded8e100-c8b2-11e9-9d64-979ffd15183f.gif" target="_self"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4518827/63735579-ded8e100-c8b2-11e9-9d64-979ffd15183f.gif" alt class="img-fluid"></a></p>
            <p>As can be seen from the gif, no matter how many times I try to get IntelliJ to accept the new settings, the indentation for switch cases resets upon clicking OK.</p>
            <p>I've already unticked 'Detect and use existing file indents for editing.' but that hasn't helped.</p>
            <p>Would appreciate if anyone has any insight into the issue, thank you!</p>

            <p>Heyyo,</p>
            <p>I had the same issue when trying to complete Level-7 as well, and I didn't want to make it such that the file had to pre-exist/be created by the user before using the program.</p>
            <p>Here's some articles on stackoverflow that I referred to for this problem: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9620683/java-fileoutputstream-create-file-if-not-exists">Create File if not exists</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2833853/create-whole-path-automatically-when-writing-to-a-new-file">Create whole path automatically</a>.</p>
            <p>In short, use .getParentFile().mkdirs() on your file object to create the necessary directory, and use .createNewFile() to create the file itself. Hope that helps!

            <p>I presume you're on Windows 10.</p>

              <li>Click Environment Variables:</li>

            <ol start="3">
              <li>Under system variables, look for a JAVA_HOME and double click it and modify the variable value to the path of your JDK 11 (without the /bin folder).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If it doesn't exist, create one (but I presume it should, since gradle is already working, else it would throw an error message.)</p>
            <p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4518827/63953040-25952980-cab3-11e9-8853-7607680cffce.jpg" target="_self"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4518827/63953040-25952980-cab3-11e9-8853-7607680cffce.jpg" alt class="img-fluid"></a></p>
            <p>The steps would differ if you use Mac OS (and I am not too sure, since it worked out of box for me), but you can try referring to <a href="https://medium.com/zendesk-engineering/setting-java-home-on-mac-os-acd44e3a6027">this Medium article</a>              for that.

            <p>I infer that you're on Mac OS from the directory structure your indicated. It seems that Prof and Jeffry didn't encounter the issue as Mac OS/Unix systems in general are much more anal than Windows when it comes to file naming conventions
              (being case-sensitive by default, amongst other things).</p>
            <p>edit: I just did some quick research and it turns out that Windows automatically removes whitespaces from directories while macOS/Unix does not. So do take note when addressing your file names!</p>
            <p>Hope that helps and don't forget to close the issue if it's been resolved!

            <p>That looks like a print statement, so I dug through your code to find it.</p>
            <p>Your program uses the file /data/duke.txt relative to the directory that the jar file is launched.</p>
            <p>In your case, you likely launched the jar file from the <code>build</code> folder and since it didn't already have a data/duke.txt, that triggered the print statement in Line 46 of your Duke.java (according to <a href="https://github.com/ChangUo79/duke/blob/master/src/main/java/Duke.java">your latest commit here</a>),
              hence printing 'File not found.'</p>

            <p>Hmm, as @Nanosync suggested, you probably need to refresh your gradle configuration within IntelliJ. It might have been the case that you did not click the prompt to import gradle configuration changes within IntelliJ when you modified your
              build.gradle.</p>
            <p>Try refreshing again? I've attached a gif of how to do so just in case:</p>
            <p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4518827/64838311-21294e80-d625-11e9-8f35-203fa493a389.gif" target="_self"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4518827/64838311-21294e80-d625-11e9-8f35-203fa493a389.gif" alt class="img-fluid"></a></p>
            <p>Otherwise, can you also try re-importing your project?</p>

            <p>I think this is best illustrated with an example.</p>
            <p>Let's say we have a while loop that can loop <strong>up to</strong> 100 times.</p>
            <p>For us to achieve a 100% statement coverage - we just need to test one iteration of the while loop. That executes all the statements within the while loop's code block - thereby achieving full statement coverage.</p>
            <p>To achieve full path coverage, we have to test for every possible path - that means that we test the while loop for 1, 2, 3 ... 99, 100 iterations each time, to ensure that it produces the correct result each time. That's a far more comprehensive
              test, and only when all paths have been exhausted through testing can it be considered full path coverage. And definitely a lot more work to be done, testing-wise.</p>
            <p>This applies to any form of conditionals or loops within a program - you'd have to test all possible number of iterations and/or all possible branches to ensure 100% path coverage, as compared to once for statement coverage.</p>
            <p>Hope that illustrates it for you!

            <p>Remove the following lines from your build.gradle</p>
            <p><code>id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.0.7' //javafx</code> (line 6)</p>
            <p>and</p>
            <p>`javafx {</p>
            <pre><code>version = &quot;11.0.2&quot;

modules = [ 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml' ]
</code></pre>
            <p>}` (line 23-27)</p>
            <p>they are no longer required as the JavaFX dependencies will be specified by lines 43 - 60 instead (you can also optionally choose to remove line 55 - 60 as they are unnecessary).</p>
            <p>Your jar file generated by shadowJar should then be able to run on any system.</p>
            <p>However, I noticed another bug during testing - your program won't launch if the file data/duke.txt is not present. You might want to look into ways to create the file automatically instead of throwing an exception and closing - see <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/forum/issues/27">https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/forum/issues/27</a></p>

            <p>I am trying to implement a function to add an image to a profile of a person. Currently, I am retrieving the image files through the <code>resources/images/</code> directory. What I am trying to implement allows the user to add/edit the profile
              image by choosing their own image files that is in a folder <code>images</code> that is in the same directory as the jar file generated. I am having issues getting this to work. I have tried looking for solutions online but it doesn't seem
              to work.

            <p>Previously, I did my increments on a separate branch but did a pull instead of a pull request and had already merged. I wanted to do the pull request anyway, so I added a commit each to the CodeQuality branch and the Assertions branch and
              created the pull request this way:</p>
            <p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54112270/64906425-01735280-d719-11e9-801a-18eceb60f760.png" target="_self"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54112270/64906425-01735280-d719-11e9-801a-18eceb60f760.png" alt class="img-fluid"></a></p>
            <p>Afterwards, I did a pull on my master branch on sourcetree and it became like this:</p>
            <p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54112270/64906459-a42bd100-d719-11e9-9f52-6746a3f68071.png" target="_self"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54112270/64906459-a42bd100-d719-11e9-9f52-6746a3f68071.png" alt class="img-fluid"></a></p>
            <p>Now I am slightly hesitant to pull for CodeQuality and Assertions as more problems might arise. I looked through and it seemed fine but felt that it would be better to have a second opinion before proceeding.</p>

              <p>In the second case, <code>File imageFile = new File(IMAGE_DIRECTORY + value);</code> assumes that the given path starts from the project root directory (i.e. starting from <code>/main/...</code>). However, your image is actually stored in
                the resource folder, which is not the root level directory. The first case works because <code>getResourceAsStream</code> reads a file from <code>src/main/resources</code>.</p>

            <p>But what if the jar file isn't inside the project directory and moved to another directory with an <code>images</code> folder? For example, i moved the jar file to <code>Documents</code> and there is an <code>images</code> folder. How then

            <p>Hello again! A new issue has arise after the previous issue was solved. Currently many of my test cases are failing due to this line <code>photo = new Image(&quot;file://&quot; + imageFile.toURI().getPath());</code> for some reason. From what
              I know, there is some initialization problem and there is trouble getting the images.</p>

              <p>I suspect the bulk of these errors goes down to the failure to initialize <code>Photo</code>. More specifically, this RuntimeException: <code>java.lang.RuntimeException: Internal graphics not initialized yet</code>.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>In <code>Photo.java</code>, you are instantiating <code>photo</code> with type <code>Image</code>, which is a JavaFX component that depends on the JavaFX toolkit. This adds dependency to the JavaFX library right from the lower level classes.
                Thus, in unit testing, the JavaFX toolkit is not set up since only classes that extend <code>Application</code> (or subclasses of these classes) will start up the toolkit but here, only <code>MainApp.java</code> extends <code>Application</code>.
                Hence,
                <code>Image photo</code> cannot be instantiated.</p>

              <p>Perhaps you can let the <code>Photo</code> class have an instance variable that contains the file path of the image file, then instantiate the <code>Image</code> within the <code>Ui</code> component using this file path!</p>

            <p>It's not explicitly shown but avoidance of custom written parser and serialization should reduce the possibilities of bugs, I think? Since standard libraries are battle-tested.</p>

            <p>This is the 100th issue in this forum. Congratulations! 💯</p>
            <p>I have a question for discussion. We are developing software that can quite easily be changed and tested, without much cost, and in doing so we are following some software engineering principles. However, there are some software projects where
              the relevant software <strong>cannot</strong> be changed once it is deployed, and where any error <strong>is</strong> fatal to the system (and possibly to people too).</p>
            <p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Parker_Solar_Probe.jpg/640px-Parker_Solar_Probe.jpg" target="_self"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Parker_Solar_Probe.jpg/640px-Parker_Solar_Probe.jpg" alt class="img-fluid"></a></p>
            <p>One example is the Parker Solar Probe (NASA illustration above). Because it goes so close to the sun, any error in the alignment of its solar shield <strong>will</strong> permanently damage its electronics. The same applies for almost all
              space probes and manned spaceflights.</p>
            <p>What kinds of software engineering principles would apply to these special projects?

            <p>Our team was getting many &quot;this branch is out-of-date with the base branch&quot; messages on pull requests, like the one below:</p>
            <p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54175463/65835326-8bc1d600-e317-11e9-82b0-34e5764625e0.png" target="_self"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54175463/65835326-8bc1d600-e317-11e9-82b0-34e5764625e0.png" alt class="img-fluid"></a></p>
            <p>But this causes headaches when syncing with the local repos. To avoid this:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>follow the instructions in <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork">the GitHub help page linked in the pull request description above</a> to add the upstream repo (<code>git remote add upstream ...</code>)</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><code>git pull</code> the latest changes from upstream (<code>git pull upstream master</code>)</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><code>git push</code> to the forked repo</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>and finally check that in the branch to be merged there is no &quot;<em>n</em> commits behind&quot; in the commit count description above the file list. The first one is bad and will cause the out-of-date error, the second one is good
                  and will not:

            <p>I've finished the two tutorials for week 6, and both requisite branches are present. I've also made a PR for my <code>tutorial-adding-command</code> branch, and the tangled lines in the log are a result of me pushing a few more commits to

            <p>The strange thing is, even after complaining about the test failures in the lecture, I managed to fix them with the IDE debugger, around nine hours before this announcement (see #87 and my branch's commits linked from there, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/Parcly-Taxel/main/commit/8475c2f822eecf570a475af7250f18d313acd292">this</a>).

            <p>I'm just guessing it's untested behavior from saving an event task and loading it (somehow tries to load it as a deadline task). You can try clearing your savefile and see if your jar file opens without issue?

            <p>Have you checked if the <code>photo</code> is actually created, and that no errors were raised and dropped by the AddressBook?</p>
            <p>I suspect that the URI does not actually translate into URL. Otherwise, I think it might be due to the lack of escape slashes in the string.

            <p>I think the main course behind the issue &quot;could not find or load main class Duke&quot; is because java cannot find the <code>.class</code> file of Duke to load it. When Duke was in the <code>package duke</code>, was the <code>mainClassName</code>              in your gradle is <code>duke.Duke</code>?

            <p>Uhm what did you put for the <code>mainClassName</code> in your <code>build.gradle</code> file though? Is it <code>duke.Launcher</code>? If yes, did you put your <code>Launcher</code> class inside a package called <code>duke</code>?

            <p>I faced similar issues as well and what I did is I first determine which test fails first and also why it fails (from the console which shows the assertions error). The most common problem I faced is the actual <code>Command</code> or <code>CommandResult</code>              generated is <strong>not equal</strong> to the expected one. It's usually due to differences in some values, for example, the content of the <code>remark</code> in the <code>CommandResult</code>, which is usually because of putting different
              values for the field in where the expected result is generated and where the actual command is generated. (sometimes the result is generated from the data file)</p>
            <p>I put a breakpoint at the relevant line before the assertion in the test method (which fails) and run the debugger and track the value of <code>Command</code> and/or <code>CommandResult</code> step by step, stepping into the relevant methods
              as necessary. I focus especially on the value(inner content) of <code>Command</code> or <code>CommandResult</code>, e.g. <code>name</code> and <code>address</code>. When I found out the point <strong>where the difference in value occurred</strong>,
              I will do some backtrack to find <strong>where</strong> the actual <code>Command</code> and/or <code>CommandResult</code> is generated to see what causes the differences in value and then fix it accordingly.</p>
            <p>Hope this helps!

            <p>Looks like IDEA would only optimize imports on changed files, and that was the reason why it didn't apply the new rules to all files. I right clicked on src folder and optimized every file inside and now it passed tests. Thanks!

            <p><code>https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=eugeneteu&amp;sort=groupTitle&amp;sortWithin=title&amp;since=2019-09-06&amp;timeframe=commit&amp;mergegroup=false&amp;groupSelect=groupByRepos&amp;breakdown=false&amp;tabOpen=false</code></p>

            <p>note the # turning into %23.</p>
            <p>I been searching around for a fix so was wondering if anyone here managed to fix this already. Note that all other hyper links work in the pdf.</p>

            <p>Hey guys I integrated the GUI tests from AB4 and wrote some unit tests. On my local terminal, everything works fine (all tests pass) and check style passes but somehow on Travis, the build stalls after starting the GUI tests.</p>
            <p>This causes Travis to trigger an error message stating that there's no output.</p>
            <p>Was wondering if anyone has ran into this issue when setting up their GUI test.</p>
            <h2 id="code-log-trace-2">Code/Log Trace<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#code-log-trace-2"></a></h2>
            <p>For code, you can link to your branch on GitHub. For short code snippets, you can copy and paste in code block:</p>

            <pre><code class="hljs">
 seedu.address.ui.CustomerListPanelTest &gt; performanceTest() STARTED



No output has been received in the last 10m0s, this potentially indicates a stalled build or something wrong with the build itself.

Check the details on how to adjust your build configuration on: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/common-build-problems/#build-times-out-because-no-output-was-received



The build has been terminated



</code></pre>
            <p>The fix that travis directs me to is to simply wait for longer (right now the build terminates after 10 mins)but as my tests are working fine, its probably an issue of me not integrating the gui test properly with travis.</p>
            <p>I have also tried manually running the Gradle method that travis runs and it works fine on my local terminal!</p>
            <p>Will appreciate it if someone could point me in the right direction</p>

            <p>Strange, the link works when I sent the pdf to my windows / linux users, but Mac users face similar issues on their local files.</p>
            <p>I confirmed this result with a spare windows laptop I have lying around.</p>
            <p>So it seems like we would still be able to submit the pdf, just that Mac users will face a broken reposense link

            <p>Hi I've been having this issue when trying to set-up Travis CI for the group project and enable the auto-publishing of docs. The error seems to be the line in red, and I've tried running the gradle test and checkstyle tests individually with
              both pass so I'm not sure what's wrong. The only files changed were the readme.adoc and the .iml files that got added I believe from setting it up as an IntelliJ project. Does anyone have any idea what might be wrong?</p>

            <p>Hi, when running my JUnit tests from Gradle I get the following output but I'm not sure what to make of it. I've reread the instructions and am fairly certain my set-up is correct and the folder structure is fine as well, is there something
              else I might be doing wrong? I've done some googling but they suggest other dependency issues and I find the code quite difficult to understand as well as it is usually part of larger projects. I've attached the code of my JUnit tests below
              was well.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Technically, that's not a problem. Gradle just recognized that there were no new changes and skipped testing. As a result, no results were reported to IntelliJ. By running <code>:cleanTest</code>, you basically forced Gradle to compile and
                run the tests again.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Yea I just realised taking a closer look that the folder structure doesn't seem to be an issue. However, I still get the &quot;Test events were not recieved&quot; original error even after running gradlew cleanTest and can't see the output
              of the tests passing as shown in the examples I've seen. Am I correct in assuming my tests work for now though and is there anything I need to change to get the same output as shown below? Or am I correct in assuming everything is fine and
              the result shown in the example below is because Gradle was not used?</p>

            <p>Ok thanks again for your help I think I more or less figured it out! One last question, when I swapped to IntelliJ IDEA and then selected &quot;Add JUnit 5.* to classpath&quot; under Test as per the instructions under Week 3, my test files
              now get errors highlighted and when I try to run all tests I get the error:</p>
            <p>&quot;No tests were found&quot; and the popup &quot;Tests were not found in module &quot;test&quot;. Use module &quot;main&quot; instead&quot; as shown in the screenshot below. When I switched back to Gradle the tests still ran fine. Is there
              any way to configure it such that I can switch between both easily? I suspect the adding JUnit to classpath was what caused the error as simply swapping to using IntelliJ in the settings did not cause the issue at first. Else it seems I'll
              stick to using Gradle though I want to understand what's happening here.</p>
            <p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38809578/64131816-c3fbf480-cdfd-11e9-9687-cded4a55d510.PNG" target="_self"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38809578/64131816-c3fbf480-cdfd-11e9-9687-cded4a55d510.PNG" alt class="img-fluid"></a></p>
            <p>Edit: Even after switching back to Gradle in the settings, right-clicking and running all tests results in the errors shown above. Only when I run gradlew test from the command line does the test complete successfully.</p>

            <p>Hi Prof,</p>
            <p>I understand from the style guide that switch statements should look like this.</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs">
String test = &quot;abc&quot;;

switch (test) {

case &quot;abc&quot;:

    # doStuff

    break;

case &quot;bcd&quot;:

    # doOtherStuff

    break;

default:

    throw new Exception();

}

</code></pre>
            <p>May I know what the style should be when the switch statement uses scopes in their cases.</p>
            <p>Should it be like this?</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs">
String test = &quot;abc&quot;;

switch (test) {

case &quot;abc&quot;: {

    # doStuff

    break;

}

case &quot;bcd&quot;: {

    # doOtherStuff

    break;

}

default: {

    throw new Exception();

}

}

</code></pre>
            <p>The rationale for having curly brackets in switch statements is to provide a scope for the case's variables.</p>
            <p>Consider this scenario:</p>
            <p>It will fail to compile because the variable foo is being declared twice.</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs">
switch (test) {

case &quot;abc&quot;:

    String foo = &quot;bar&quot;;

    break;

case &quot;bcd&quot;:

    String foo = &quot;baz&quot;;

    break;

}

            <p>Regarding exceptions</p>
            <p>I’m of the view that strictly following 1a or 1b is not an optimal solution.</p>
            <p>Instead, I think that wherever possible, we should use Java’s exceptions instead.</p>
            <p>For instance, InvalidTaskId should use IndexOutOfBoundsException.</p>
            <p>In the rare scenario where we have a duke-specific exception that does not fit any of Java’s exceptions, we should extend it from DukeException.</p>
            <p>However, if the exception can be used outside of duke, and is not covered by any of Java’s exceptions, we should extend it from Exception. An example of this would be DuplicateDataException.</p>
            <p>Please correct me if I’m wrong! Would love to hear other opinions about this.

            <p>Thanks for taking the time to explain <code>git revert</code> in detail Iskandar!</p>
            <p>I'd like to add on a cautionary note about tags since we are on the note of reverting/reseting commits.</p>
            <p>If you have pushed your tags to your remote repo with <code>git push --tags</code> reverting or deleting your commits will not remove your tags on the remote repo.</p>
            <p>So how do we resolve this?</p>
            <p>You may be tempted to use <code>git tag --delete</code> but this only deletes them locally.</p>
            <p>Instead, you have to use <code>git push origin :tagname</code></p>
            <p>Alternatively, you may also update your git tags locally, then <code>git push --tags -f</code></p>
            <p>Please refer to this stackoverflow post for a more in depth discussion about removing tags on remote repos. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5480258/how-to-delete-a-remote-tag">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5480258/how-to-delete-a-remote-tag</a></p>

            <p>Okay prof, thanks for your suggestion. Yeah cause i do think there is a benefit in making such a feature, as our application will be used by hospital and people need to be careful and typically the user will want to double check if what they
              keyed in is correct. Will try to do both modes. Thanks prof!

            <p>Thanks a lot. I've found my problems.</p>
            <p><strong>1. JNI error occurs during compilcation.</strong></p>
            <p>My solution: This error may happen if you have changed your JDK version before. delete old JDK version and reopen duke project worked for me.</p>
            <p><strong>2. If you have created multiple files for different classes.</strong> Modified my .bat as follows</p>
            <p><code>javac -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\Task.java ..\src\main\java\Todo.java ..\src\main\java\Event.java ..\src\main\java\Deadline.java ..\src\main\java\DukeException.java ..\src\main\java\Duke.java</code></p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Uhm what did you put for the <code>mainClassName</code> in your <code>build.gradle</code> file though? Is it <code>duke.Launcher</code>? If yes, did you put your <code>Launcher</code> class inside a package called <code>duke</code>?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Yes. I put Launcher inside package duke and change mainclass in build.gradle. And gradle run command is successful without any problem. This error occurs only when I run my jar file.

            <p>Thanks for your contribution to this question.</p>
            <p>Because the quiz question asks whether the diagram shows the correct association role but the diagram shows association label. The diagram fails to show the role.

            <p>For context, our team is trying to build an organ-matching desktop application, which matches Patients to Donors. Currently, I am trying to add in a command to match a particular Patient to all the donors in the database. After matching the
              Patient to the Donor, a list with matching Donors and its success rate should be displayed.</p>
            <p>Example output:</p>
            <img width="1437" alt="Screenshot 2019-10-23 at 4 29 09 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27060502/67373691-a3a51680-f5b2-11e9-8e67-01a8c2410541.png">
            <p>The issue comes when instead of displaying the Donors and its success rate of matching, it displays the Donors only, without the match result. There is no pattern as to when it displays the wrong output. For example, the first time I type
              in <code>match ic/NRIC</code>, it displays the Donors with the match results. But when I type in the same command, it displays the Donors without the match results. I have tried many combinations of commands but still cannot find a reason
              as to why this problem occurs.</p>

            <p>I decided to use a third party library for my data storage called Gson instead of the normal .txt storage methods for extension D-Trivia. The application works fine when I was testing it in IntelliJ, however, when I exported it out to a jar
              file, there was a NullPointerException pointing to what should have been something that Gson took care of. My question now is is there a way to manually include the dependency inside shadowJar? And if such a solution is not possible, is
              there any other way to make it work through gradle configurations?</p>

            <p>Hi prof,</p>
            <p>Quick question, but how exactly do you push git tags? After a quick search online I came across this answer:</p>
            <p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5195859/how-do-you-push-a-tag-to-a-remote-repository-using-git">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5195859/how-do-you-push-a-tag-to-a-remote-repository-using-git</a></p>
            <p>However, after adding the --follow-tags option to the end of git push, I could not find any evidence that the tag has been pushed. Furthermore, the answer also discourages the use of git push --tags, for which I also still do not know the
              reason. Are there multiple ways to push tags to the repository and if so which is the most appropriate? Also, how do you find evidence of your tags being pushed? Please redirect to another answer if the issue has been resolved already.

                on online forums and it seems that <code>Label</code> does not adjust based on the size of your text (in this case, the tasks that Duke prints), so there was a recommendation to use <code>Text</code> shape instead. Let me know if this

            <p>As a direct consequence of the IEEE 754 format for floating point numbers, it is impossible to achieve 100% accuracy and precision in testing floating point values. A pragmatic heuristic to follow involves factoring in the inputs to the method
              and padding the expected return value with a suitable error threshold.</p>
            <p>For example, 0.1 + 0.2 is not equal to 0.3 in this format. Keep this in mind while designing unit tests and choose an appropriate error tolerance range. Another good practice for mathematical methods is to test them against similar existing
              implementations

            <p>In the unabridged developer guide presented in AB3, the sequence diagram for the delete command doesn't destroy the instance 'd' of the 'DeleteCommand' class. Upon scrutinizing the code in the LogicManager class, it is evident that 'd' is
              futile after the command has been executed. This is because the resultant details are contained in a 'CommandResult' object.</p>
            <p>Below the sequence diagram associated with the developer guide, there is an annotation that highlights an inherent defect of PlantUML which makes it unable to render object lifelines correctly when the object is pre-maturely destroyed, as
              in the case of the 'DeleteCommandParser' object.</p>
            <p>This prompts me to ask - is the lifeline of the 'DeleteCommand' object inaccurately shown as continuing because of an error with PlantUML, or is it because of a subtler additional usage later on?

            <p>How much abstraction is too much? Adding an extra layer of abstraction has its costs and benefits. In most cost-benefit analyses of abstraction, benefits would be a clear winner.</p>
            <p>SLAP seems to be a good guideline in general. However, it is highly likely we reach a stage where further abstractions cause more harm than good. That is, after a point, the costs (refactoring and debugging) would outweigh the benefits. What
              is a good guideline to follow to ensure that we're adding another layer of abstraction that has enough information to be significant? Is there a quantitative measure, like the reduction in the LoC in the original method, to determine the
              'impact'?

            <p>If I could opine in on this issue, I'd say both approaches have their pros and cons, which you've highlighted in the above comments. While Object-Level validations align with the essence of OOP, it could be a bit tedious to deal with similar
              cases in multiple objects. This will ultimately lead to a lot of redundant and repeated code.</p>
            <p>A partial solution could be to handle common cases like white-space/empty inputs at the input-class level, leaving the object constructors to deal with more specific invalid inputs relevant to their associated objects.</p>
            <p>To add on, we could abstract the input class at a higher level to a machine that accepts input. The machine has no idea what the valid input for other machines (objects) are. However, there are certain inputs that are invalid inputs for ALL
              objects. These can be handled at the input class level.

            <p>@damithc I think I resolved the problem, by removing a file with name &quot; .\src\test\java\dream\fcard\util\data\Test.java &quot; from my repo. Then, RepoSense produced a valid report after I removed this file with slashes in the name.</p>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/huiminlim/main/commit/c3215ba03a6d3d2c126d98f9b6c0b2376a3ffebc">https://github.com/huiminlim/main/commit/c3215ba03a6d3d2c126d98f9b6c0b2376a3ffebc</a></p>

            <p>After configuring my git username as according to the instructions on the cs2103 website last week, I submitted the pre-lecture survey and submitted the git username that I have configured.</p>
            <p>However, I just noticed that despite not having tracking enabled, I did not receive any emails from cs2103 bot about it (like my friends did), nor received any other emails for any other purposes. It came to my realisation that my git username
              has been reset to my full name rather than the username I had previously configured (and suspect this was possibly due to entering the rm -R .git command last week in an attempt to reset some terminal display features that were affected
              by the setting up of git)</p>
            <p>I have now enabled issues tracking, and reconfigured my username back to what I believe I previously submitted in the pre-lecture survey, but I'm not entirely sure whether it is correct.</p>
            <p>Is there any way to double-check or confirm whether cs2103 bot is now able to track my progress on the duke repository that was forked on my account?</p>
            <p>Thank you and sorry for any inconvenience caused.

            <p>Is your <code>Checkstyle version</code> in your settings set to <strong>8.1</strong>?</p>

            <p>I looked through the release notes for Checkstyle and found that version 8.2 removed the <code>FileContentsHolder</code> module, which would explain the failure to instantiate the module and thereby, the exception thrown since Gradle uses
              version 8.1.
            </p>
            <p>I changed my checkstyle version to 8.24 and received the same error that you received as well.

            <p>Hmmm, based on the Travis job log it seems like the build failure is not due to <code>constructor_missingFileUrl_throwsAssertionError()</code> and <code>constructor_invalidFileUrl_throwsAssertionError()</code> tests failures.</p>

            <p>In the second case, <code>File imageFile = new File(IMAGE_DIRECTORY + value);</code> assumes that the given path starts from the project root directory (i.e. starting from <code>main/...</code>). However, your image is actually stored in the
              resource folder, which is not the root level directory. The first case works because <code>getResourceAsStream</code> reads a file from <code>src/main/resources</code>.</p>
            <p>You might want to consider letting your <code>IMAGE_DIRECTORY</code> = <code>src/main/resources/images/</code> for the time being, while still running in the IDE. This will allow <code>new File(IMAGE_DIRECTORY + value)</code> to get the file
              from the root directory.

              <p>But what if the jar file isn't inside the project directory and moved to another directory with an <code>images</code> folder? For example, i moved the jar file to <code>Documents</code> and there is an <code>images</code> folder. How then

            <p>Ah I see! I suspect your solution would work if the jar file is actually the case as you mentioned. However, if you are still running from your IDE, this method would break down since <code>new File(...)</code> will attempt to read from the
              root project directory.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>I examined your code further and realised that your <code>IMAGE_DIRECTORY</code> = <code>/images/</code> instead of <code>images/</code>.</p>
            <p>Placing a leading slash makes the path an absolute file path instead of a relative path, thus this references to <code>C:/images/</code> (assuming you're using Windows), instead of <code>C:/path/to/jar/folder/images/</code>.</p>
            <p>In addition, <code>new Image(path)</code> requires <code>path</code> to start with <code>file://</code> in order to load the image through <code>ImageView</code>.</p>
            <p>Hence, to sum up, you might want to try the following changes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><code>IMAGE_DIRECTORY = images/</code></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><code>new Image(&quot;file://&quot; + imageFile.toURI().getPath())</code></p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I've tried these changes on my end and it works through the jar file. Hope it works for you as well! 😃

            <p>Glad to hear it works!</p>
            <p>It should be able to work in the IDE as well, provided you have an <code>images</code> folder in your root project directory i.e. <code>main/images/</code>. You can specify this folder in <code>.gitignore</code> so that it won't be pushed
              into the remote repo.</p>
            <p>Additionally, note that your application does not automatically create an <code>images</code> folder in the root directory, so you might want to consider automatically creating this folder when your user launches the app to aid your user.

            <p>Hi!</p>
            <p>I suspect the bulk of these errors goes down to the failure to initialize <code>Photo</code>. More specifically, this RuntimeException: <code>java.lang.RuntimeException: Internal graphics not initialized yet</code>.</p>
            <p>In <code>Photo.java</code>, you are initializing <code>photo</code> with type <code>Image</code>, which is a JavaFX component that depends on the JavaFX toolkit. This adds dependency for the JavaFX library right from the lower level classes.
              Thus, in unit testing, the JavaFX toolkit is not set up since only classes that extend <code>Application</code> (or subclasses of these classes) will start up the toolkit but here, only <code>MainApp.java</code> extends <code>Application</code>.
              Hence,
              <code>Image photo</code> cannot be initialized.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you can let the <code>Photo</code> class have an instance variable that contains the file path of the image file, then instantiate the <code>Image</code> within the <code>Ui</code> component using this file path!

            <p>From what I know, there are two main ways to approach error handling. Object-Level validations (raise exception in constructor) and validating user input (in whatever class handles user input).</p>
            <p>Seems like the general consensus from <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/258275/oop-behavior-data-but-what-about-validation-behaviors">this</a> Stack Overflow question is that object level validation is the &quot;right&quot;
              way to approach things from an OO perspective (e.g. one response reads &quot;The constructor should always return an instance which is in a valid state. There is no excuse for doing otherwise.&quot;) as you are more likely to accidentally
              create a god class that handles everything if you choose to validate user input.</p>
            <p>It seems that most of us chose to validate user input. Anyone have any opinions regarding this? Is validating both an excessive measure?

            <p>Let's look at the Todo object for example. We could do validation in two ways:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Validate input before passing it to the constructor (perhaps by having a method in <code>Duke.java</code> raise exception if <code>description</code> is blank).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Validate user input in Todo constructor (perhaps by raising exception if <code>this.description</code> is <code>null</code>)</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>I'm thinking of whether option 2 would be more appropriate, since it results in the Todo class being responsible for not allowing &quot;invalid&quot; Todo objects to exist, as opposed to having the main class handle it or creating a new class
              specifically to validate inputs.

            <p>Thanks for the response Sudharshan, really appreciate your contribution to the discussion.</p>
            <p>About the input class, that makes a lot of sense. It just acts as a filter to remove inputs that are obviously gibberish or incomplete, while the respective objects deal with whether the input is &quot;correct&quot; (e.g. startTime &lt; endTime).

            <p>The difference between the two commands is that <code>git push --follow-tags</code> only pushes tags that are both annotated (similar idea to commit message) and reachable (in the current commit history).</p>
            <p>Let's start with reachability. Imo it doesn't make sense to have a tag pointing to an unreachable commit (unless you, for some reason, want to keep a copy of it) and more importantly may confuse people.</p>
            <p>As for annotations, they are there to give meaning to the tag you have created by giving a short summary of what the tag is for (e.g. what does &quot;Level-6&quot; of your project mean? What major change does it introduce?).</p>
            <p>Hope this helped to clarify some of your doubts. I've only recently read up on tags so please correct me if I'm wrong. The Stack Overflow post links to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11514075/what-is-the-difference-between-an-annotated-and-unannotated-tag">another</a>              post that explains annotated tags and their use cases quite well, I recommend giving it a read.

            <p>Thanks Shawn, I believe your solution should quickly solve OP's issue. Lets take a moment to appreciate the difference between a revert and reset. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8358035/whats-the-difference-between-git-revert-checkout-and-reset">This</a>              StackOverflow post should explain things pretty clearly.</p>
            <p>TL:DR, a revert introduces another commit that basically undoes the reverted commit. A reset however, undoes changes by changing the commit history.</p>
            <p>An analogy would be as such:</p>
            <p>Imagine you were writing an essay and for every revision you would have a new copy (i.e. essay1.docx, essay2.docx, essay3.docx, essay4.docx). You mistakenly deleted your entire intro paragraph in essay3.docx and need to fix it. A revert would
              be to undo the deletion and save it as essay5.docx while a reset would be to delete everything from essay3.docx onwards and start from essay2.docx.</p>
            <p>If you have the time to spare, I highly recommend <a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/">this</a> git tutorial. It gives really simple and elegant real-time visualisations of git branches as you perform commands, so you get a rough idea
              of whats happening to the commit history instead of it feeling like you're just playing with magical commands.</p>
            <p>If anyone else has any tips regarding reverting/resetting please feel free to add on to the discussion

            <p>I am somewhat confused as to what constitutes a &quot;bug&quot; for the PE. Which of the following count as bugs?</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Application behaves in a manner described in the UG, but this behavior is unintuitive/confusing to user, or does not make sense.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Application behaves in a manner described in the UG. UG notes that this behavior is expected for certain inputs, but instructs user not to enter such inputs.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Application feature does not support an operation. UG does not mention this operation at all, however, user thinks the operation should be supported.

            <p>Refer to question title. If a class is never instantiated, we can still call static methods of that class. How would we show this in a sequence diagram? In particular, what would the entity tag show? Should it still show <code>:ClassName</code>              even when we are not calling methods on an instance of the class?

            <p>If I were to add a feature that allows sharing of data (via exporting and importing a file), would that count as a violation of the constraint? I figure it might not be because it should be quite easy for a single user to test this feature,

            <p>Ah yes, something useful to know.</p>
            <p>I have no idea what the duplicated modules are doing. Don't even know what a module is O: Hopefully Prof can explain a little bit about classpath, duplicated modules, what gradle does behind the scenes etc.</p>
            <p>Shall not mess with the structure for the time being, but its always good to know how to remove modules.

            <p>I have a doubt: Is it allowed to have the <code>while</code> loop outside an activation bar? I think I have seen both being drawn but I wasn't too sure. That is can a loop start before an activation bar is present i.e. considering the only
              three objects present are instances of <code>Foo</code>, <code>Bar</code>, and <code>Gee</code>? Would this answer change if there is are objects apart from these not shown in this diagram (from where the function calls like <code>do()</code>              are coming, for example)?

            <p>What I did was that I changed from <code>Label</code> to the shape <code>Text</code> in both my <code>MainWindow.java</code> and <code>DialogBox.fxml</code> (changed in <code>DialogBox.fxml</code> using Scene Builder). I had read up a bit
              on online forums and it seems that <code>Label</code> does not adjust based on the size of your text (in this case, the tasks that Duke prints), so there was a recommendation to use <code>Text</code> shape instead. Let me know if this works!

            <p>I wouldn't think it's an error with any of my java files in the project. Like I mentioned, the only thing that I did was creating a JAR file. I did no modifications whatsoever to the java files so I wouldn't think that the error lies there.
              Plus, when I sent the same JAR file to a friend of mine, he was able to run it without any problems.</p>
            <p>More specifically, I'm particularly concerned about these lines right here:</p>

            <p>I could be wrong here but it seems something related to the jdk is wrong instead, and I don't know what it is.

            <p>Along with the debugger, using <em>Go To -&gt; Implementation</em> is very useful to quickly view a method's code. In addition to the above, here are fixes for two other failing test cases. Hope it will be of use to someone.</p>

            <p>Association roles are used to indicate the <strong>role played by the classes</strong> in the association. For example, in an association between classes A and B, class A could play the role of the husband and class B plays the role of the
              wife.</p>
            <p>Association labels are the ones shown in the diagram you linked. They <strong>describe the meaning of the association</strong>. An easy way to distinguish between them is the black arrow present in association labels. Also, it often describes
              a relationship whereas association roles tend to be nouns like 'friend' or 'helper'!</p>
            <p>This diagram is false because an association label is shown in the diagram, not an association role. I can't remember exactly but I think the question was asking if this was a valid association role! Otherwise, it is a perfectly valid association
              label.

            <p>Hi Prof and classmates/tutors,</p>
            <p>I am using Functional Interfaces in my tP to implement call-back functions and am wondering what the proper way to represent them in UML (class diagram?) is.</p>
            <p>From online sources I have found this: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28095981/how-represent-a-java-functional-interface-in-a-component-diagram">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28095981/how-represent-a-java-functional-interface-in-a-component-diagram</a></p>
            <p>which doesn't seem to be in the scope of the textbook.</p>
            <p>My usage is as such:</p>
            <p>The class <code>AppManager</code> passes a method reference of one of it's own methods into a <code>Timer</code> class.</p>
            <p>This method is stored inside the <code>Timer</code> class as a nested Functional Interface.</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs">
class AppManager {

    void appMethod() {

        // do something ...

    }



    public static void main(String[] args) {

        AppManager app = new AppManager();

        new Timer().set(app::appMethod);

    }

}



class Timer {

    

    CallBack callback;



    void set(CallBack callback) {

        this.callback = callback;

    }



    void eventOccured() {

        callback.inform();

    }



    @FunctionalInterface

    interface CallBack {

            <p>Hmm... I understand what you mean, Prof. My main intention in using call-backs at all was to avoid cylic dependency and high coupling between <code>AppManager</code> and <code>Timer</code>.</p>
            <p>Initially, my idea was to describe the structural relationship this way:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p><code>AppManager</code> is aware of <code>Timer</code>.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><code>Timer</code> however is not directly aware of <code>AppManager</code> (<code>Timer</code> is only aware of a method of <code>AppManager</code>).</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>However, I realise if I were to draw this out as a Class Diagram, I would have</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>A solid arrow from <code>AppManager</code> to <code>Timer</code></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>A dotted-arrow (?) from <code>Timer</code> to <code>AppManager</code> as <code>Timer</code> is &quot;dependent&quot; on <code>AppManager</code>'s method.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>This depiction would suggest a cyclic dependency between <code>AppManager</code> and <code>Timer</code> ... which is what I am attempting to avoid.

            <p>Hi all, the following is a short guide on how to resize and position images and captions nicely in <code>asciidoc</code> for both HTML and PDF.</p>
            <p>I couldn't find any resources only so it took a while to figure out how to format the images for my PPP. Hopefully this might be helpful for some of you =)</p>
            <h2 id="resizing-images">Resizing Images<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#resizing-images"></a></h2>
            <p><strong>Step 1.</strong> The following is the standard way to embed images in <code>asciidoc</code>. By default, the width of the image in HTML will be 100% of the image size or 100% of the page width, whichever is smaller.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs">
.This is my image

image::my_image.png[]

</code></pre>
            <p>translates to</p>
            <p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39181981/68538267-bf7b2b80-03ac-11ea-8027-e27f90d49486.png" target="_self"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39181981/68538267-bf7b2b80-03ac-11ea-8027-e27f90d49486.png" alt class="img-fluid"></a></p>
            <p><strong>Step 2.</strong> To resize the image for HTML, use the <code>width</code> attribute of the image. You can adjust the size using either the percentage of page width (e.g. <code>width=50%</code>) or by absolute size of the image (e.g.
              <code>width=10cm</code>).</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs">
.This is my image

image::my_image.png[width=50%]

</code></pre>
            <p>translates to</p>
            <p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39181981/68538304-534cf780-03ad-11ea-910a-b4e8baebb849.png" target="_self"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39181981/68538304-534cf780-03ad-11ea-910a-b4e8baebb849.png" alt class="img-fluid"></a></p>
            <p>However, this might cause formatting issues when exporting to PDF, as seen below</p>
            <p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39181981/68538750-8941aa00-03b4-11ea-8663-6f3c5d57d5cf.png" target="_self"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39181981/68538750-8941aa00-03b4-11ea-8663-6f3c5d57d5cf.png" alt class="img-fluid"></a></p>
            <p><strong>Step 3.</strong> To adjust the width of an image in PDF, use the <code>scaledwidth</code> attribute instead. The <code>scaledwidth</code> attribute can be used together with the <code>width</code> attribute without causing formatting
              issues for HTML. However, do note that the <code>scaledwidth</code> attribute can only be adjusted by absolute size (e.g. <code>scaledwidth=12cm</code>)</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs">
.This is my image

image::my_image.png[width=50%, scaledwidth=12cm]

</code></pre>
            <p>which translates to</p>
            <p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39181981/68538777-c1e18380-03b4-11ea-9748-c875d717202d.png" target="_self"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39181981/68538777-c1e18380-03b4-11ea-9748-c875d717202d.png" alt class="img-fluid"></a></p>
            <h2 id="positioning-images">Positioning images<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#positioning-images"></a></h2>
            <p>Images like UML diagrams and captions should ideally be aligned to center. While it is possible to align images to the center in HTML, ~<strong>it is currently not possible to do so for captions in HTML</strong>.~ See @geshuming comments on
              this PR on how to do it for captions in HTML. However, it is still possible to do so in PDF.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 1.</strong> To align images (but not captions) in the center for both HTML and PDF,. use the <code>align</code> attribute.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs">
.This is my image

image::my_image.png[align=&quot;center&quot;, width=50%, scaledwidth=12cm]

</code></pre>
            <p>which translates to</p>
            <p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39181981/68538462-c5bed700-03af-11ea-8bd5-8dc6ed91dd0e.png" target="_self"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39181981/68538462-c5bed700-03af-11ea-8bd5-8dc6ed91dd0e.png" alt class="img-fluid"></a></p>
            <p><strong>Step 2.</strong> To align both images AND captions in the center for PDF, a few more steps are needed. Instead of using the PDF feature in Intellij, we have to install a command line version of <code>asciidoctor-pdf</code> from
              <a
                href="https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-pdf/">this link</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 3.</strong> By default, <code>asciidoc-pdf</code> aligns images and captions to the left, so we need to change this configuration. In the command line, execute the following command to find the directory where the ruby gems are
              stored</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs">

            <p>a. define new sub-classes of Exception for each different error (eg. NoSuchTaskType, ShutDownException, InvalidTaskId), or</p>

            <ol start="2">
              <li>If 1a is preferred, should we continue to extend all these custom exceptions from Exception, or should we extend them from DukeException instead?</li>

            <p>All the suggestions here have been great so far. Admittedly, my original examples were a little contrived for the sake of the discussion (if anyone was wondering, no, I definitely did not use an invalidTaskId custom exception).</p>
            <p>To sum up for any future readers, the general consensus seems to be that we first re-use any exceptions that's already defined in the Standard Java SDK (I would think that this applies even to third-party SDKs if there's a heavy reliance on
              them in the project), and if that is not sufficient for describing the exception, we extend our own from wherever is applicable/most-related. The aim is to make the Exceptions as understandable as possible to future programmers, and one
              clearest way of doing it is to use Exceptions that are already standardised among all programmers in the standard SDK.</p>
            <p>My personal take on this issue so far has been to define a custom DukeException class with an overloaded constructor that takes in both an exceptionMessage as well as a Throwable cause (essentially, the original exception that caused it eg.
              IndexOutOfBoundsException). The DukeException wrapper around the the original exception makes it neater to deal with the way Duke handles most exceptions (by throwing the message to the user in some user-readable form eg. &quot;You need
              to provide me with a task ID!&quot; when no task ID is given). Chaining the exception with a DukeException also makes it clear that I as the programmer expected this specific error to occur and have attempted to handle it for the specific
              usage (instead of having a random IndexOutOfBoundsException occur, which is very clear in what was violated but not so much as to what it means for the specific functioning of the program ie. the cause-effect relationship). It's kind of
              a compromise, so to speak.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, in the rare cases when I need more specific information to handle the exception at a lower-level (which is unlikely at this stage, but you never know in the future), I can simply retrieve the root cause of the DukeException by
              calling getCause() on the DukeException or by performing a detailed stackTrace print.</p>
            <p>Hope this is helpful. Since it's well into week 6, and this being a week 3 issue with satisfactory answers, I'll be closing the issue here. Do feel free to re-open this if you feel there are more points that merit discussion! Thanks to everyone
              who took their time to reply.

            <p>When I am trying to double click and open the jar file compiled using gradle shadowJar on a mac with Jar launcher(A mac utility app to open jar file), it prompts me saying it cant be lauched and check console for error message. The closest
              two things in my console that looks like an error message is in the code below, but after much googling I cant seem to figure out what is the problem, may I get some help? The jar file runs perfectly fine when opened from terminal. Will
              this affect grading since grading is based on jar file?</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, after doing the quiz, I am confused by some of the answers.</p>
            <p>The following question's answer is <code>False</code>. Why is Bot considered not keeping track of Mat class? Bot has Mat attribute.</p>
            <p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25873970/66126467-0fcbd480-e61c-11e9-86c7-3e96fecab417.png" target="_self"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25873970/66126467-0fcbd480-e61c-11e9-86c7-3e96fecab417.png" alt class="img-fluid"></a></p>
            <p>The following question's answer is <code>False</code>, with the reason being that: <code>This is not an association role. It's an association label.</code> Why is this not a valid diagram? In the textbook, the label <code>used by</code> is
              valid for Admin&lt;-&gt;Student. From what I understand, these association labels are to describe the verb, so <code>helped by</code> should be a valid label.</p>

            <p>The following question's answer is <code>False</code>, with the reason being that: <code>A Mat can have up to 5 helpers, not exactly 5 helpers.</code> The code shows <code>new Bot[5]</code> so that made me confused.</p>

            <p>As @geshuming mentioned, those are the errors. To prevent such issues, you can try adding <code>*.iml</code> to <code>.gitignore</code> and remove the related files from the repository since they are generated by IntelliJ.

            <p>Hello, I also ran into the same problem. For me, it was due to the mainClassName in build.gradle. After i changed it to &quot;Launcher&quot;, then the error is gone.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>application {</p>
            </blockquote>
            <pre><code>mainClassName = &quot;Launcher&quot;
</code></pre>
            <p>}</p>
            <p>Otherwise, check if you imported the javafx files into ur jar file before building it.

            <p>Maybe you can try setting your VBox / Hbox (which ever u use to wrap your content) Min height/width to USE_PREF_SIZE via the SceneBuilder.

            <p>Just to add on, you will need <code>git add</code> the files that you have fixed before running the above command again. Otherwise, you may see the same error thrown despite having fixed the problem. The reason is that <code>run-checks.sh</code>              will call <code>git grep --cached</code> which searches in the staging area.

            <p>I made a test folder in 'src', marked it as test source root, made the DukeTest.java with a dummyTest to try if it works.</p>
            <p>No matter how many times I tried, I get an &quot;Error: java: error: release version 13 not supported.&quot;</p>
            <p>I tried running it using gradle.</p>
            <p>I have tried keeping the test folder in different places, set up the project again and imported junit 5.4 from maven libraries since it was asking me to add android studio sdk to ass directly.</p>
            <p>Couldn't really find a helpful solution on the internet.</p>
            <p>Any suggestions on how to go about with this?</p>
            <p>Addition1: Testing works just fine in a local repo of mine. The issue is in the dukerepo.</p>
            <p>Addition2: I set up gradle. When I try running 'gradle test' it shows &quot;Test events not received&quot; everytime.

            <p>My terminal was running on JDK 1.8 Prof when I compiled the program some time ago. But for creating the shadowJar, I had to update it to JDK 11. I think the error occurred due to the difference in JDK versions for compilation and creation
              of Jar. So I just compiled the program again (JDK 11). It is working now but I am not very sure if that was the problem. 😕

            <p>The fixes mainly involve integrating the Remark class with the rest of addressbook. I've also put my changes in a <a href="https://github.com/KendrickAng/main/commit/9b7159bc66317fb7a83e9fbe76bba82b15c8c0a5">commit</a>, which follows immediately
              from the end of the tutorial.</p>
            <p>Here's my (very incomplete) notes trying to figure out what went wrong:</p>
            <p><strong>1. execute_storageThrowsIoException_throwsCommandException</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>AddCommandParser should be able to parse remarks from the argMultiMap. If this was the first test case failure you looked at, AddCommandParser#parse still returns a new Remark(&quot;&quot;) as stated in the tutorial, which is incorrect.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. parse_optionalFieldsMissing_success()</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>AddCommandParser needs to support remark parsing (like the above).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>3. parse_allFieldsPresent_success()</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Update PersonBuilder and AddCommandParserTest#asserParseSuccess's <em>userInput</em> fields.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>4. toModelType_typicalPersonsFile_success()</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>JsonAdaptedPerson.java detects that your remarks are null (because we haven't added them).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>update typicalPersonsAddressBook.json to include the &quot;remark&quot; json object field.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>There's also no remark in TypicalPersons.java (which should match typicalPersonAddressBook.java), so this cases the default remark in PersonBuilder to be used instead, giving us incorrect output.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>5. toModelType_duplicatePersons...</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>duplicatePersonAddressBook.json is missing a remark field. Add <strong>the same</strong> remark for both json objects in the file.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>-&gt; Fixing some of these errors caused others to spring up:</p>
            <p><strong>6. execute_allFieldsSpecifiedUnfiltered</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>The EditCommand needs to allow editing remarks too.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Update: EditCommand.java, EditPersonDescriptor.java, EditPersonDescriptorBuilder.java</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>6.1 This causes the parseCommand_edit... test case to fail.</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>update EditCommandTest#getEditPersonDescriptorDetails to include remarks.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We can make use of the debugger in Intellij to 'Step in' the failing tests.</p>
            <p>After stepping through a few levels, we will realise that most of the failing tests are due to the fact in the file <code>CommandTestUtil.java</code>, we are missing:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p><code>public static final String VALID_REMARK_AMY = &quot;valid remark amy&quot;</code></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><code>public static final String VALID_REMARK_BOB = &quot;valid remark bob&quot;</code></p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>(These are as per the other fields required in building a <code>Person</code> object).</p>
            <p>Adding these two final Strings and using them in the tests will allow most tests to pass as expected.</p>
            <p>We also need to take note that these stub remarks will need to be consistent with the ones in the <code>TypicalPersonsAddressBook.json</code> for the test to pass since the test will compare between the constructed person and the person stored
              in the .json file.

            <p>Instead of editing the code, click on the &quot;Wrapping and Braces&quot; option in the bar directly above the code, then scroll down and look for &quot;'switch' statement&quot; and untick &quot;Indent case branches&quot;. The change will
              be reflected in the sample code.

            <p>I had a similar problem.</p>
            <p>For me, disabling the Maven plugin seemed to make the &quot;Next&quot; button reappear.</p>
            <p>Also curious if this will have any repercussions later on in the project.

            <p>Hi @nattanyz , I faced a similar issue as yours when I packaged my app.</p>
            <p>Basically, there are two things you can do:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Under Edit Configurations...(option is beside the hammer on the top right) &gt; Application &gt; Duke, change the &quot;Use classpath of module:&quot; to duke.main instead of main</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Under File &gt; Project Structure... &gt; Modules, remove the main and test modules (as this should already be under 'duke &gt; main' &amp; 'duke &gt; test')</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>You shouldn't need to remove the <code>package duke;</code> from your Duke.java file and the mainClassName on Gradle should be left as <code>duke.Duke</code>. Hope this helps.
            </p>

            <p>I also have the same issue, and i did not change the mainClassName to Launcher class in gradle.build file. Are we supposed to change it to Launcher?

            <p>@tuandingwei the cause of the error wasn't the test cases. I believe it was from either ASCIIDoctor or Coveralls as there is some dependency within the CI there. We tried commenting out asciidoctor or coveralls but both resulted in further
              errors because asciidoctor relies on coveralls do generate a html file that is required. we've gotten it to pass temporarily by commenting out our deploy segment within our gradle file but that affects our publication

            <blockquote>
              <p>I understand files in my jar file is accessed via <code>getResource</code>. So how should i access files outside of my jar in this case?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Maybe try doing it the same way as storage? Storage creates a <code>data</code> folder in the same directory as the jar file.
