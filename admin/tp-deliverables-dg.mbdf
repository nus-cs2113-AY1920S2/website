* **Should match the v1.4 implementation**.
* **Optionally, can include proposed implementations of future features.**
* {{ icon_important_big_red }} **Include an appendix named _Instructions for Manual Testing_**, to give some guidance to the tester to chart a path through the features, and provide some important test inputs the tester can copy-paste into the app.
  * **Cover all user-testable features** but no need to cover existing AB3 features if you did not touch them.
  * **No need to give a long list of test cases** including all possible variations. It is upto the tester to come up with those variations.
  * **Inaccurate instructions will be considered bugs**.
* {{ icon_important_big_red }} **We highly recommend adding an appendix named `Effort`** that evaluators can use to estimate the total project effort.
  * Keep it brief (~1 page)
  * Explain the difficulty level, challenges faced, effort required, and achievements of the project.
  * Use AB3 as a reference point %%e.g., you can explain that while AB3 deals with only one entity type, your project was harder because it deals with multiple entity types%%.
