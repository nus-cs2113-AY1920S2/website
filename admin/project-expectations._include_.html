    <p>Accordingly, the tP is structured to resemble an intermediate stage of a non-trivial real-life brownfield software project in which you will,</p>
    <ol>
      <li>conceptualize and implement enhancements to a given product, and,</li>

<p>The tP uses a generic application called <a href="https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level3/">AddressBook-Level3 (AB3)</a> (from <a href="https://se-education.org">https://se-education.org</a>) as the starting point.</p>

          <li>It is an opportunity to exercise your product design skills because optimizing the product to a very specific target user requires good product design skills.</li>
          <li>It minimizes the overlap between features of different teams which can cause plagiarism issues. Furthermore, higher the number of other teams having the same features, less impressive your work becomes especially if others have done a better
            job of implementing that feature.

        </ul>
      </panel>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Define a clear <em>value proposition</em></strong> that matches the target user profile i.e., what problem does the product solve? how does it make the the user's life easier?</li>
      <li><strong>Optimize the product to the chosen target users</strong> i.e., add features that are especially/only applicable for target users (to make the app especially attractive to them).
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Example 1: If the product targets CS2113/T instructors, there can be features that are applicable to them only, <span class="dimmed">such as the ability to navigate to a student's project on GitHub</span></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Example 2: If your app manages contacts, you can optimize its features based on,</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the profession of the target user <span class="dimmed">e.g. doctors, salesmen, teachers, etc.</span></li>
              <li>the nature/scale of contacts <span class="dimmed">e.g. huge number of contacts (for HR admins, user group admins), mostly incomplete contacts, highly volatile contact details, contacts become inactive after a specific period (e.g. contract employees)</span></li>
              <li>what users do with the contacts <span class="dimmed">e.g. organize group events, share info, do business, do analytics</span></li>

<p><strong>The expected level of <em>functionality</em> from a 5-person team is roughly the <mark>equivalent effort taken to create AB3 <em>functionality</em></mark></strong>. Some examples meeting that criterion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Example 1: A fictional contact management app optimized for a specific target user group:
<ul>
<li>Existing AB3 features are optimized to the new target user group.</li>
<li>Person objects are enhanced to contain more details.</li>
<li>There are a 4-5 new functionality that are specific to the target user group.</li></ul></li>
<li>Example 2: a FooBar app that keeps track of two different types of entities <em>Foo</em> entities and <em>Bar</em> entities.
<ul>
<li>Foo and Bar entities are tightly-connected e.g., a Foo entity can contain Bar entities. Each type is similar to AB3 Person objects in terms of complexity.</li>
<li>In addition to <tooltip content="Creat Read Update Delete">CRUD</tooltip> for Foo and Bar entities, there are a 4-5 FooBar-specific functionality, some of which involves both Foo and Bar entities e.g., link a Foo entity to a Bar entity.</li></ul></li></ul>
<box>
<p><span class="badge badge-pill badge-warning"><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-lightbulb"></span></span> If you wish to add the following features to your app, we recommend (but not require) you to follow similar features in AB4 in order to

      <p>Note that we have reduced the tP functionality expectations for this semester by about 40-50% compared to the previous semester, in order to reduce your workload. <mark>Adding more functionality than the expected level will not increase your marks</mark>.

    <p><strong>Tip: Contribute to all aspects of the project</strong> e.g. write backend code, frontend code, test code, user documentation, and developer documentation. <span class="dimmed">Reason: If you limit yourself to certain aspects only, you could lose marks allocated for the aspects you did not do. In addition, the final exam assumes that you are familiar with all aspects of the project.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tip: Do <em>all</em> the work related to your enhancement yourself.</strong> <span class="dimmed">Reason:If there is no clear division of who did which enhancement, it will be difficult to divide project credit (or assign responsibility for bugs detected by testers) later.</span></p>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Tip: Divide the components of the product among team members</strong>. Notwithstanding the above, you are still recommended to divide the components of the product among team members so that each team member is <em>in charge</em> of one or
      more components. While others will be modifying those components as necessary for the features they are implementing, your role as the <em>in charge</em> of a component is to guide others modifying that component <span class="dimmed">(reason: you are supposed to be the most knowledgeable about that component)</span>      and protect that component from degrading <span class="dimmed">e.g., you can review others' changes to your component and suggest possible changes</span>.</p>
