* **Have a good screen grab tool** with annotation features so that you can quickly take a screenshot of a bug, annotate it, and post in the issue tracker.
  * {{ icon_tip }} You can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> to paste a picture from the clipboard into a text box in bug report.

* **<span class="text-danger">Download the product to be tested</span>** <tooltip content="notifications are likely to go out on the morning of the PE/PE-D session">after you have been notified</tooltip>.
  * PE Dry Run (at **{{ penultimate_version }}**): Download the jar file from the team's releases page.
  * PE (at **{{ final_version }}**): Download the zip file that bears your name (location will be announced via module announcements, 24 hours before the PE).

* **Charge your computer** before coming to the session. The testing venue might not have enough charging points.
