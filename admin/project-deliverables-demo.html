          <li><strong>Strictly 18 minutes for a 5-person team, 15 minutes for a 4-person team</strong>, 21 minutes for a 6-person team. Exceeding this limit will be penalized.</li>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Assume you are giving a demo to a higher-level manager of your company</strong>, to brief him/her on the current capabilities of the product. This is the first time they are seeing the new product you developed but they are familiar
            with the AddressBook-level3 (AB3) product. The actual audience are the evaluators (the team supervisor and another tutor).</li>

        <h4 id="demo-scope"><span class="badge badge-info">Demo</span> <span class="text-info">Scope</span><a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#demo-scope"></a></h4>
        <ul>
          <li><mark><strong>Start by giving an overview of the product</strong></mark> so that the evaluators get a sense of the full picture early. Include the following:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>What</strong> is it? <span class="dimmed">e.g., FooBar is a product to ensure the user takes frequent standing-breaks while working.</span></li>
              <li><strong>Who</strong> is it for? <span class="dimmed">e.g., It is for someone who works at a PC, prefers typing, and wants to avoid prolonged periods of sitting.</span></li>
              <li><strong>How</strong> does it help? Give an overview of how the product's features help to solve the target problem for the target user</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="indented-level2">
          <box>
            <p>Here is an example:</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs">Hi, welcome to the demo of our product FooBar. It is a product to ensure the user takes
frequent standing-breaks while working.
It is for someone who works at a PC, prefers typing, and wants to avoid prolonged periods
of sitting.
The user first sets the parameters such as frequency and targets, and then enters a
command to record the start of the sitting time, ... The app shows the length of the
sitting periods, and alerts the user if ...
...
</code></pre>
          </box>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>There is no need to introduce team members or explain who did what. <span class="dimmed">Reason: to save time.</span></li>
          <li><strong>Each person should do a fair share of the demo</strong>. However, it's OK for one member to do all the typing.</li>
          <li><strong>There is no need for you to demo your own work</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Present the features in a reasonable order</strong>: Organize the demo to present a cohesive picture of the product as a whole, presented in a logical order.</li>
          <li><strong>No need to cover design/implementation details</strong> as the manager is not interested in those details.</li>
          <li><strong>No need to demo features inherited from AB3</strong> unless they are needed to explain your new features. <span class="dimmed">Reason: existing features will not earn you marks, and the audience is already familiar with AB3 features.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="demo-structure"><span class="badge badge-info">Demo</span> <span class="text-info">Structure</span><a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#demo-structure"></a></h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Demo the product using the same executable</strong> you submitted, on your own laptop, using the TV.</li>
          <li><strong>It can be a <em>sitting down</em> demo.</strong> You'll be demonstrating the features using the TV while sitting down. But you may stand around the TV if you prefer that way.</li>
          <li><strong>It will be an uninterrupted demo.</strong> The audience members will not interrupt you during the demo. That means you should finish within the given time.</li>
          <li><strong>Use a sufficient amount of <tooltip content="`Mr aaa` is not a realistic person name"><em>realistic</em></tooltip> demo data.</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g at least 20 contacts</span>. Trying to demo a product using just 1-2 sample
            data creates a bad impression.</li>
          <li><strong>Dress code</strong>: The level of formality is up to you, but it is recommended that the whole team dress at the same level.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="demo-tips"><span class="badge badge-info">Demo</span> <span class="text-info">Tips</span><a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#demo-tips"></a></h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Plan the demo to be in sync with the impression you want to create.</strong> For example, if you are trying to convince that the product is easy to use, show the easiest way to perform a task before you show the full command with all
            the bells and whistles.</li>
          <li><strong>Spend as much time as possible on demonstrating the actual product.</strong> Not recommended to use slides (if you do, use them sparingly) or videos or lengthy narrations. Avoid skits, re-enactments, dramatizations etc. This is not a
            sales pitch or an informercial. While you need to show how a user use the product to get value, but you don’t need to act like an imaginary user. For example,<br> [Instead of this] <code>Jim get’s a call from boss. &quot;Ring ring&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;oh hi Jim, can we postpone the meeting?&quot; &quot;Sure&quot;. Jim hang up and curses the boss under his breath. Now he starts typing ..etc.</code><br>            [do this] <code>If Jim needs to postpone the meeting, he can type …</code><br> It’s not that dramatization is bad or we don’t like it. We simply don’t have enough time for it. Note that CS2101 demo requirements may differ. Different context
            → Different requirements.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Showcase how the feature improves the user’s life</strong> rather than simply describe each feature.</li>
          <li><strong>Rehearse the steps well</strong> and ensure you can do a smooth demo. <mark>Find a <a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sleight-hand-white-lies-bottle-scotch-how-apple-pulled-off-first-iphone-launch-1600085"><em>golden path</em></a> and stick to it</mark>.
            Poor quality demos can affect your grade.</li>
          <li><strong>Don’t waste time repeating things the target audience already knows.</strong> e.g. no need to say things like &quot;We are students from NUS, SoC&quot;.</li>
          <li><strong>No need to introduce next presenter</strong> at the end of your part <span class="dimmed">Reason: to save time</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="demo-special-circumstances"><span class="badge badge-info">Demo</span> <span class="text-info">Special circumstances</span><a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#demo-special-circumstances"></a></h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>If a significant feature was not merged on time:</strong> inform the tutor and get permission to show the unmerged feature using your own version of the code. Obviously, unmerged features earn much less marks than a merged equivalent
            but something is better than nothing.</li>
          <li><strong>If you are unable to come to the demo due to a valid reason</strong>, submit the evidence of your excuse <span class="dimmed">e.g., MC</span> to prof. The demo is part of module grading and <mark>absence without a valid reason</mark>            will cause you to lose marks.</li>
